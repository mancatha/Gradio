# P4-Gradio

# Introduction 
The deployment process in data analysis and machine learning is a crucial step that involves making the analysis results and predictive models available for practical use. We use Gradio framework for building our web application with python for our project.

## Project Description
- In this project, is the continuation of LP2 we aim to develop a web application for the customers. We use Gradio framework for building our web application with python for our project.
- Gradio simplifies the process of building user interfaces for machine learning models and provides a way to expose your models or functions via a user-friendly interface. We use Gradio to create web-based interfaces for our model, making it accessible through a web browser. It can take inputs, process them using the model or function, and display the results in real-time. Gradio is a tool for building interactive interfaces, but you can use it in conjunction with web servers.
